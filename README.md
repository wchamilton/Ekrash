# What is a Dungeon Crawling Deckbuilding Game
A Dungeon crawler is a game where you explore different "rooms" on a "floor" or "level" progressively upgrading yourself as you go. A Deckbuilder is a game where you start with a basic set of "cards", representing abilities you have, and during encounters you get to use those cards to assist you. As you progress, you'll have the ability to grow your deck with new cards or remove unecessary cards.
Ekrash combines these to give the player the ability to fine tune their deck and progress ever deeper into the dungeon.

# Objective
The objective is to progress as deep as you can into the dungeon to find various loot in the form of cards, artifacts, gold, and other... encounters.

# Story
In a remote land there lie the entrance to a labyrinth. A place so dangerous, few dare enter. This place is known only as "The Dungeon". In the remote town of Serrin, lies the entrance to "The Dungeon". Many have gone in, and only few have come out. Those who have emerged have returned with riches beyond their wildest imaginations. Due to this, a new career of "Dungeoneers" emerged. One of high risk, but equally high reward.

One day an adventurer returned with an odd sort of relic. This relic was unlike anything the people had ever seen, it was a kind of bracelet adorned with ancient, indecipherable runes. Perplexed by the relic, the lord ordered a significant amount of research to be done into the device. This research unveiled that the relic (which would be later referred to as The Mantle) allowed for the user to be enhanced in several ways. These included certain physical attributes such as strength, speed, and perception. The lord, being power hungry as he was, ordered the relic to be kept only to the royalty. Over time however, as more dungeoneers ventured further in, more of these mantles were found and sold to the populace.

All your life you've stared at the dungeon, wondering about all its mysteries. Being born in Serrin, you've heard all the great stories of how dungeoneers have battled the most menacing of monsters. It is your 16th birthday and you've finally been allowed to take the entrance exam. However there's one problem, having come from a poor family, you've never had access to one of these famed "Mantles". Regardless of that, due to your endless training in the woods, you manage to pass the entrance exam (albeit barely) and are able to enter the dungeon...
